# Payment Card SVGs

Hand-tuned to be tiny, accurate, and up to date.

All five images have a combined weight of **3.9KiB** (and that's un-minified and un-gzipped).

### Sources

I went down a rabbit hole to find decent looking logos in any format, but proper SVGs for something so ubiquitious as payment icons shouldn't be so hard to find.... Hopefully this helps someone else.

* **American Express** - They have a Complimentary Signs and Supplies page that includes a [pack of SVGs](https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/us/merchant/supplies/product/digital/CHECKOUTDL.zip). I redrew their shapes by hand to use the negative space instead of a bunch of positive-space shapes (hooray for no arcs).

* **Discover** - Woof. Their official site has only tiny bitmaps, and every version floating around used an embedded PNG instead of actual vector shapes. This one came from the AmEx pack, but I redid the gradient to be as minimally recognizable as possible (even though I kind of want to ignore it to come in a little brutally smaller, but it seems like an important part of Discover's identity).

* **Mastercard** - They publish [official SVGs](https://brand.mastercard.com/brandcenter/mastercard-brand-mark/downloads.html)! How helpful. I redrew it to be simpler primitive shapes for extra smallness, but was careful to retain their proportions and hex colors.

* **PayPal** - This very excellent use of shapes comes from the very excellent [SuperTinyIcons](https://github.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons). A specific contributor or license for this icon didn't present itself to me from browsing their commit history....

* **Visa** - This one's hard to track down. The logo collection sites and Wikipedia all have strange transforms applied where the shape is actually upside down and reversed, etc. The cleanest copy ended up coming from the AmEx pack. I ditched the framing bars based on how the official Visa site presents the logo most often, and its lack of appearance on any current card designs.
